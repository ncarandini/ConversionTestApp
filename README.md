# ConversionTestApp
A project to test .NET Satandard and &lt;PackageReference> conversion from the Xamarin Forms (PCL) project
created by the Visual Studio 2017 (vers. 15.1) template.

I've created this project to see if I could follow the process illustrated by Oren Novotny in his post:
[Using Xamarin Forms with .NET Standard and VS 2017](https://oren.codes/2017/04/23/using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard-vs-2017-edition/)
and mimic his repo: https://github.com/onovotny/SampleXamFormsWithNetStandard
